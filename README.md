# rivo.io-exploit
generate infinite discount code, if the site allows. site i tested on allowed for discounts when you add your email to their mailing list, idk if this code will even work otherwise

rivo is a "loyalty" platform for shopify stores. i didnt deep it that much i just made the bot for the one store i was gonna use

dont ask for help

how to use:

do it once in chrome with the network tab open

find the request to "https://{storename}/apps/ba-pop/subscribers"
you need:

widget id
shop field, so the non domain name (can also be found in the payload of the req): for example testing123.myshopify.com
the storename which u gotta get urself like `example.com` (no https or /'s)


i havent tested this idek if theres sites that use rivo for mailing list/popups but this is it ig
